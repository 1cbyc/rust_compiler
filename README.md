# rust_compiler

by now, if you are familiar with me, you would know that anywhere they're cooking rust, i'd be there for it. anyways, i am taking my hate for rust to the next level. even tho i would not have done this, but i was thinking the `rustc` compiler was written in `c` only to check and i realized it was in fact written in `rust-lang` wtf! eeewwww bruhhh!

anyways, i have decided it is time to take this hatred to the next level. i will be building a rust compiler in c. i know it will be hard to do, and in fact, might not work as fast as `rustc` but it will definitely be worth my time, as long as my hate is peaked!


## how i intend to go about this whole thing

- let me write a lexer to convert rust to tokens first, then i will know what to do.
![by the way, i understand rust very well and can build stuff with it. so, i don't remotely hate it, i actually hate it by experience just like a girl that cheated on her man.]
