# where we at

**The project is in its very early stages. To build a working Rust compiler, we'll need:**
1. Complete the Lexer - Implement token recognition for Rust syntax
2. Parser - Convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. Type Checker - Implement Rust's type system
4. Code Generator - Generate machine code or intermediate representation
5. Standard Library - Implement basic Rust std library functions
