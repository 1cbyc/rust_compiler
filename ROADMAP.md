# rust compiler development roadmap

## phase 1: lexical analysis - completed
- [x] define all rust token types
- [x] implement lexer with proper error handling
- [x] support for all rust keywords
- [x] support for all operators and delimiters
- [x] support for literals (integers, floats, strings, chars)
- [x] support for comments (single-line and multi-line)
- [x] line and column tracking for error reporting
- [x] python test script for validation

## phase 2: syntax analysis - in progress

## current focus: phase 2 - parser implementation

### next immediate tasks:
1. **define ast node structures**
   - expression nodes (literals, variables, operators)
   - statement nodes (declarations, control flow)
   - declaration nodes (functions, structs, enums)
   - type nodes (primitives, user-defined)

2. **implement basic parser**
   - start with simple expressions
   - add function parsing
   - add variable declarations
   - add control flow statements

3. **create parser tests**
   - test with simple rust code
   - verify ast structure
   - error handling tests

### success criteria for phase 2:
- [ ] can parse `fn main() { let x = 42; }`
- [ ] can parse basic expressions: `1 + 2 * 3`
- [ ] can parse if/else statements
- [ ] can parse simple struct definitions
- [ ] proper error messages for syntax errors

## timeline estimate:
- **phase 1**: completed (1 week)
- **phase 2**: in progress (2-3 weeks)
- **phase 3**: planned (3-4 weeks)
- **phase 4**: planned (2-3 weeks)
- **phase 5**: planned (4-6 weeks)
- **phase 6**: planned (2-3 weeks)
- **phase 7**: planned (2-3 weeks)
- **phase 8**: planned (1-2 weeks)
- **phase 9**: planned (1-2 weeks)
- **phase 10**: planned (ongoing)

**total estimated time**: 6-12 months for a basic working compiler

*this roadmap is flexible and will be updated as we progress through the implementation.*
