## phase 2 completion summary

### completed in phase 2:
- [x] **ast node structures defined**
   - expression nodes (literals, variables, operators)
   - statement nodes (declarations, control flow)
   - declaration nodes (functions, structs, enums)
   - type nodes (primitives, user-defined)

- [x] **complete recursive descent parser implemented**
   - variable declarations (`let x = 42;`, `let mut name: String = "rust";`)
   - basic expressions (`1 + 2 * 3`)
   - function declarations with parameters and return types
   - operator precedence parsing
   - primary expressions (literals, identifiers, parentheses)
   - function calls (`println!("hello")`)
   - control flow statements (if/else, while, for, return)
   - struct definitions with fields
   - enum definitions with variants
