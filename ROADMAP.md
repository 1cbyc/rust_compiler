## Current Focus: Phase 2 - Parser Implementation

### Next Immediate Tasks:
1. **Define AST Node Structures**
   - Expression nodes (literals, variables, operators)
   - Statement nodes (declarations, control flow)
   - Declaration nodes (functions, structs, enums)
   - Type nodes (primitives, user-defined)

2. **Implement Basic Parser**
   - Start with simple expressions
   - Add function parsing
   - Add variable declarations
   - Add control flow statements

3. **Create Parser Tests**
   - Test with simple Rust code
   - Verify AST structure
   - Error handling tests

### Success Criteria for Phase 2:
- [ ] Can parse `fn main() { let x = 42; }`
- [ ] Can parse basic expressions: `1 + 2 * 3`
- [ ] Can parse if/else statements
- [ ] Can parse simple struct definitions
- [ ] Proper error messages for syntax errors

## Timeline Estimate:
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Completed (1 week)
- **Phase 2**: ðŸš§ In Progress (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (3-4 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 5**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (4-6 weeks)
- **Phase 6**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 7**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 8**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 9**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (1-2 weeks)
- **Phase 10**: ðŸ“‹ Planned (ongoing)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-12 months for a basic working compiler
